# Profile
profile: |
  I'm a FullStack Developer with 10+ years of experience, having worked in many
  different contexts, from academia to startups. Nowadays I specialize mostly in
  Ruby on Rails (Backend) but through the years I've worked with a lot of
  different technologies. I have a passion for well-designed products, love
  teamwork and short feedback loops.

      The company was founded as a spin-off from the works done at SMART, in
      order to create a commercial version of the software I've worked over the
      years. Working with clients from 5 continents, I've fulfilled requirements
      on multiple fronts, from performance, scalability, API development to
      front-end user interface implementations. I was also in charge of managing
      the whole development team, ranging from mobile developers to other
      backend developers. I've been responsible for the whole infrastructure
      (migration to cloud services, automatic provisioning, continuous
      integration and deployment).
